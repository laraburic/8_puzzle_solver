# 8_puzzle_solver

The purpose of this program is solving the 8-puzzle problem with a given initial state using uniform cost search and A* search with a Manhattan distance heuristic.

# search functions
My solution to this puzzle involves a Solver class which implements a breadth first search as the basis for uniform cost and A* search in order to make all search functions as 
general as they can be.
